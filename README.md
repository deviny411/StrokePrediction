# ðŸ§  Stroke Detection Using Machine Learning  

This repository contains the source code and resources for my research project on **early stroke detection** using machine learning techniques. The project leverages feature selection methods such as **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** and **Permutation Feature Importance (PFI)** to build interpretable, reliable models that can assist in medical diagnosis.
